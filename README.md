# Horiseon: Refactoring of Web Landing Page

## Description
Horiseon is a company specialising in improving the SEO scores of customer websites.

The landing pages on one of Horiseon's own websites required refactoring to improve its SEO score.

Update included:
  Refactoring of legacy code using semantic HTML to improve accessibility, without changing the look/feel of the page;
  
  Note that although Alt attributes are in use, they are left empty as the pictures are purely aesthetic.
  
  Likewise the use of figure and figcaption is non-helpful, so not used.
  
  It is necessary to compress the original images due to their extreme size and impact on performance.
  
  Repair of broken links.
  
  Restructuring of CSS to improve readability and simplify any future edits.
  
  Addition of comments where considered appropriate.

## Usage
The project is a simple web page, with address:  https://cancer2806.github.io/Horiseon_Wk1_Homework/

CSS is contained in one file:  ./assets/css/style.css

Images are all contained in a local directory:  ./assets/images/
