# Horiseon_Refactoring of Web Landing Page (Week 1 Homework)

## Description
Horiseon is a company specialising in improving the SEO scores of customer websites.

The landing pages on one of Horiseon's own websites required updating to improve its SEO score.

Updating included:
  Refactoring of legacy code using semantic HTML to improve accessibility, without changing the look/feel of the page;
  Note that although Alt attributes, have been used, they have been left blank as the pictures are purely aesthetic.
  Likewise the use of figure and figcaption was considered non-helpful.
  It was necessary to compress the original images due to their extreme size and impact on performance.
  Repair of broken links.
  
  Restructuring of CSS to improve readability and simplify any future edits.
  
  Addition of comments where considered appropriate.

## Usage
The project is a relatively simple web page, with address:  
CSS is contained in one file:  ./assets/css/style.css
Images are all contained in a local directory:  ./assets/images/
